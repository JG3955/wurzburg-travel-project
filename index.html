            <h2>Why Würzburg?</h2>
            <h3>Würzburg, a pleasant harmony of history and culture</h3>
            <p>
              Würzburg is a Baroque city offering southern German flair and
              Franconian hospitality. Architectural masterpieces from various
              eras shape the cityscape. Even from afar, the two imposing towers
              of St. Kilian Cathedral – the fourth largest Romanesque church in
              Germany – point the way to the city. Würzburg's famous landmarks
              are the Würzburg Residence with its Court Gardens and Residence
              Square (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), the Marienberg Fortress and
              the 180-metre-long Old Main Bridge, which is lined with impressive
              statues of saints. Gracefully straddling the banks of the Main
              River amid idyllic vineyards, the location alone is reason enough
              to visit Würzburg.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the city's fascinating museums, at Marienberg Fortress,
              houses the largest collection of works by the famous woodcarver
              and sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider. Slightly more modern art from
              the 19th century to the present day is the focus of the
              3,500-square-metre museum in the Kulturspeicher building at the
              old port. Did you know that a different discovery, that of the
              X-ray, was made in Würzburg? Röntgen's original laboratory has
              been preserved and welcomes visitors, who can follow up the tour
              by giving the city a thorough examination.
